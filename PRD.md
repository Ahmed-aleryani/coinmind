1. User clicks microphone icon
2. Speaks: "I spent thirty dollars on groceries at Walmart today"
3. AI processes speech and text
4. System creates transaction with auto-categorization
5. User confirms or edits before saving

### Scenario 2: Receipt Upload
1. User uploads receipt photo
2. OCR processes image
3. Extracted data displayed for review
4. User confirms/edits transaction details
5. Transaction saved with receipt attached

### Scenario 3: CSV Import
1. User selects CSV file from bank
2. System auto-detects column mapping
3. Preview shows parsed transactions
4. User confirms import
5. Batch processing with progress indicator
